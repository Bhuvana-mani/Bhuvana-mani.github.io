            <p>The special cycle to ride in the track;single&Tandum</p>
            <p>It is a beautiful trip in a special cycle in a old railtrack through forest, rivers. 
                The railway, which is 93 km long, stretches from Mellerud in the south through Dalsland's and Värmland's beautiful and varied
                 nature to Kyrkerud in Årjäng, in the north. Long distances run along the edge of Dalsland's canal and other beautiful watercourses.
                 You can also travel in the canals to explore the locks.

            <p>Turn off your lights and let the chairlift transport you one step closer to space, up to Mt. Nuolja. Slowly you glide up to STF Aurora Sky Station, 900 meters above sea level.
              The mighty mountains in front of you, a starry sky above you and the silence surrounding you gives you a sense of eternity. The nature itself breathes in anticipation.
               With some luck you might see a sudden flare of green light, and before you know
              it the northern lights are dancing in the sky right above you, and you are caught in a meeting between earth and space.
              At STF Aurora Sky Station there is a large outdoor terrace and a lookout tower, 
              where you can stand gazing at the Northern Lights and the stars. 
              Inside is a Northern Lights exhibition that explains the Aurora Borealis. 
              If you want to learn more about the Northern Lights, you can join one of the Northern Light presentations held by the guide several times during the evening.
               Whilst waiting for the Northern Light to appear you can sit and relax in the cosy café, treat yourself to a Swedish “fika” or browse around for a souvenir </p>
